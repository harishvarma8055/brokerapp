 The running account credit agreement gives you an easy way to spread 
the cost of your insurance premium over a period of time. It is 
specifically designed for the repayment of insurance premiums and isn’t 
suitable for any other use.</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;"><br></span></p><p style="font-size:20px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#767676;">Q) What will it cost me?</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">A)
 You will have to pay back the money you draw down under the agreement 
and pay interest, a facility fee (if charged) and any credit arrangement
 fee you may have been charged by your broker if you have chosen to fund
 this with us.</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">Your
 minimum monthly payments are calculated by adding interest to the 
amount you’ve drawn down and dividing that total by the number of months
 over which the money is to be repaid. </span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;"><br></span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">These

 Yes. As the insurance policy forms the security for your credit, your 
insurance policy is at risk of cancellation if you fail to meet your 
repayment obligations. If your insurance policy is cancelled in such 
circumstances, Close Brothers Premium Finance has the right to receive 
any proceeds or refunds paid. They will use these funds to reduce the 
amount you owe.</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;"><br></span></p><p style="font-size:20px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#767676;">Q) What will happen if I do not pay my minimum monthly payments on time?</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">A)
 You may have to pay a charge plus interest if Close Brothers Premium 
Finance doesn’t receive a minimum monthly payment on time. If you are in
 breach of the terms of the credit agreement, Close Brothers Premium 
Finance may have a right to terminate it and in such circumstances a 
termination fee may be charged. These fees are set out in the Standard 
European Consumer Credit Information (SECCI). </span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;"><br></span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">Close
 Brothers Premium Finance may enforce any security given under the terms
 of the credit agreement, which will result in the cancellation of your 
insurance policy. You’ll be liable to pay all sums owing to Close 
Brothers Premium Finance, as well as any charges. Your credit record may
 be affected, and you may find it harder to borrow from Close Brothers 
Premium Finance or another lender.</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;"><br></span></p><p style="font-size:20px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#767676;">Q) Do I have any right of withdrawal? If so, what are the terms?</span></p><p style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:'Arial Regular', 'Arial';font-weight:400;color:#1E1E1E;">A)
